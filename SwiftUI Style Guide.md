# SwiftUI Style Guide:

### üí† Use `Label` Instead of `HStack` for Icon + Text Combinations

**Why?**
> `Label` is a semantic, built-in SwiftUI component specifically designed for pairing an icon with text. It improves accessibility, reduces boilerplate, and adapts better to dynamic type, right-to-left languages, and other system-driven layout changes.

``` swift
// Avoid
HStack(spacer: 6) {
    Image(systemName: "circle")
    Text("Task")
}
```

``` swift
// Use
Label(
    title: titleText,
    icon: circleIcon
)

private func titleText() -> some View {
    Text("Task")
}

private func circleIcon() -> some View {
    Image(systemName: "circle")
}

```

<br>

<br>

### üí† Use `LabeledContent` Instead of `HStack` for Label + Value Layouts

**Why?**
> `LabeledContent` is a purpose-built SwiftUI view for showing a label and a value. It improves consistency, accessibility, dynamic type handling, and aligns better with system styles, especially in forms and settings screens.

``` swift
// Avoid
HStack {
    Text("Price")
    Spacer()
    Text("500 EGP")
}
```

``` swift
// Use
LabeledContent(
    content: amountText,
    label: priceText
)

private func priceText() -> some View {
    Text("Price")
}

private func amountText() -> some View {
    Text("500 EGP")
}
```

<br>

<br>

### üí† Prefer Explicit Parameters Over Trailing Closures for Callbacks

**Why?**
> When a function or initializer has one or more callbacks, using explicit parameter labels improves clarity. It makes the code easier to read, reason about, and maintain ‚Äî especially when scanning quickly or working with unfamiliar code.

``` swift
// Avoid
SheetView {
    // Submit Action
} onDismiss: {
    // Dismiss Action
}
```

``` swift
// Use
SheetView(
    onSubmit: {
        // Submit Action
    },
    onDismiss: {
        // Dismiss Action
    }
)
```

<br>

---

<br>

### üí† Prefer Passing Function Names Instead of Closures

**Why?**
> Passing a function name directly makes your code cleaner, shorter, and more readable. It avoids unnecessary closures, improves clarity.

``` swift
// Avoid
.onAppear {
    viewOnAppear()
}
.onChange(of: state) { oldValue, newValue in
    // Action Code
}
```

``` swift
// Use
.onAppear(perform: viewOnAppear)
.onChange(of: state, stateDidChange)

private func viewOnAppear() {}
private func stateDidChange(_ oldValue: Int, newValue: Int) {}
```

<br>

<br>

### üí† Avoid Using Outer Padding for Reusable Components

**Why?**
> Reusable components should focus only on their internal layout and content, not their external spacing. This keeps components flexible and adaptable to different contexts and gives the parent view full control over padding and layout.

``` swift
// Avoid
struct ReusableView: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            // Content
        }
        // Modifiers
        .padding(.horizontal, 25)
    }
}

struct ParentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        ReusableView()
    }
}
```

``` swift
// Use
struct ReusableView: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            // Content
        }
        // Modifiers
    }
}

struct ParentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        ReusableView()
            .padding(.horizontal, 25)
    }
}
```

<br>

<br>

### üí† Use `LocalizedStringKey` as the Input Type for Reusable Components

**Why?**
> Using `LocalizedStringKey` ensures that your custom SwiftUI views support localization seamlessly. This enables the use of localized strings without extra manual effort.

``` swift
// Avoid
struct ReusableView: View {
    let title: String

    var body: some View {
        // Content
    }
}
```

``` swift
// Use
struct ReusableView: View {
    let title: LocalizedStringKey

    var body: some View {
        // Content
    }
}
```

<br>

---

<br>

### üí† Use `verbatim` Parameter for `Text` When Displaying Non-Localized Strings

**Why?**
> The `verbatim` parameter should be used when you need to display a non-localized string. By default, `Text` uses `LocalizedStringKey`, which is designed for localized strings. Using `verbatim` ensures that your string is treated as raw text and not mistakenly processed for localization and displayed in `Localizable` table.

``` swift
// Avoid
Text("\(product.title) - \(product.price)")
```

``` swift
// Use
Text(verbatim: "\(product.title) - \(product.price)")
```

<br>

---

<br>

### üí† Use `ImageResource` Instead of `String` for Image Names

**Why?**
> Using `ImageResource` ensures type safety, avoids typos, and leverages Swift‚Äôs compiler checks to catch errors early. This improves maintainability, readability, and prevents runtime errors when working with images.

``` swift
// Avoid
Image("circle.fill")
```

``` swift
// Use
Image(.circleFill)
```

<br>

---

<br>

### üí† Use `ColorResource` Instead of `String` for Colors

**Why?**
> Using `ColorResource` ensures type safety, avoids typos, and leverages Swift‚Äôs compiler checks to catch errors early. This improves maintainability, readability, and prevents runtime errors when working with colors.

``` swift
// Avoid
Color("blue.light")
```

``` swift
// Use
Color(.blueLight)
```

<br>

---

<br>

### üí† Use `Text` `format` Parameter Instead of String Interpolation or Custom Formatters

**Why?**
> Using the `format` parameter with `Text` allows you to leverage Swift‚Äôs built-in formatting capabilities, ensuring consistent, locale-aware formatting and reducing the need for custom logic or string interpolation. It improves code clarity, maintainability, and ensures the proper handling of various data types like numbers, dates, and currencies.

**Tip:**
> When fetching date strings from a backend, convert the `String` to a `Date` in your model.

**Resource:**
> Check this website for all [SwiftUI Format Styles](https://goshdarnformatstyle.com/) in details and TONS of examples.

``` swift
// Avoid
Text("\(12)%")
Text("\(500) EGP")
Text("\(dateFormatter.string(from: someDate))")
```

``` swift
// Use
Text(12, format: .percent) // 12%
Text(500, format: .currency(code: "egp")) // EGP 500
Text(.now, format: .dateTime.day().month(.abbreviated)) // 27 Apr
```

<br>

<br>

### üí† Use Custom Modifiers Only When Necessary ‚Äî Otherwise, Use `View` Extensions

**Why?**
> Custom modifiers should be used only when you need to work with SwiftUI state, environment properties, or manage complex view-specific logic. For simple visual modifications, creating a `View` extension function is a cleaner, simpler approach that improves readability and reduces unnecessary complexity in your code.

``` swift
// No need to be used as custom modifier
extension View {
    func roundedBorders(
        radius: CGFloat,
        color: Color,
        lineWidth: CGFloat = 1
    ) -> some View {
        self
            .clipShape(.rect(cornerRadius: radius))
            .overlay {
                RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: radius)
                    .stroke(color, lineWidth: lineWidth)
            }
    }
}
```

``` swift
// Need to be used as custom modifier
struct ColorBackgroundModifier: ViewModifier {
    @Environment(\.colorScheme) private var colorScheme
    
    private var color: Color {
        colorScheme == .dark ? .blue : .cyan
    }
    
    func body(content: Content) -> some View {
        content
            .background(color)
    }
}
```

<br>

### üí† Follow Consistent Naming Conventions for SwiftUI Views

**Why?**
> Using consistent naming conventions for SwiftUI views helps maintain clarity, improves code readability, and makes it easier to identify the purpose of a view at a glance. These naming rules allow developers to quickly differentiate between screens, reusable views, and smaller UI components.

<br>

1Ô∏è‚É£ When creating a SwiftUI screen (a top-level view that represents a full screen), use the `Screen` suffix to clearly indicate its role.

``` swift
// Avoid
OrderDetailsView()
CartView()
```

``` swift
// Use
OrderDetailsScreen()
CartScreen()
```

<br>

2Ô∏è‚É£ When creating a general reusable views that are not full screens but still serve as major components, use the `View` suffix.

``` swift
// Use
ProductCardView()
BannerView()
```

<br>

3Ô∏è‚É£ When creating a small, reusable UI components (such as buttons, labels, tags, and sections), omit the View suffix to keep the name clean and concise.

``` swift
// Avoid
UnderlinedButtonView()
SectionHeaderView()
```

``` swift
// Use
UnderlinedButton()
SectionHeader()
```

<br>

4Ô∏è‚É£ When creating small reusable components with names similar to built-in SwiftUI views (e.g., Slider, Picker), use the App prefix to distinguish your custom components from SwiftUI‚Äôs built-in ones.

``` swift
// Use
AppSlider()
AppPicker()
```

<br>

<br>

### üí† When to Encapsulate a Component into Its Own `View` Struct?

**Why?**
> Encapsulating components into their own View structs improves code organization, readability, maintainability, and reusability.

<br>

**1Ô∏è‚É£ When It Contains Complex Logic**
* If the view involves complex logic (such as multiple states, interactions, or calculations), encapsulating it into a separate View struct keeps your code cleaner and more modular.

<br>

**2Ô∏è‚É£ When the View Is Reusable**
* Encapsulate views into their own structs when they need to be reused in multiple places. This improves maintainability and ensures consistency across your app.

<br>

**3Ô∏è‚É£ When the View Code Is Big**
* If a view has a lot of code or multiple layers of nested views, it‚Äôs a good idea to encapsulate it. This makes the code easier to manage, debug, and maintain.

<br>

**4Ô∏è‚É£ When the View Needs to Handle Its Own State**
* If a view has state management or complex interactions (e.g., sliders, or toggles with unique behaviors), it‚Äôs a good practice to encapsulate it. This ensures the view has full control over its internal state without affecting other views.

<br>

**5Ô∏è‚É£ When the View Has Its Own Business Logic**
* If a view has its own small business logic (like fetching data, or reacting to local changes), it should encapsulate that logic inside itself rather than pushing it up to the parent view. This keeps the parent view simpler and the logic closely tied to the UI it affects.

<br>

**6Ô∏è‚É£ When You Need to Handle Animation or Transitions**
* For views that handle animations or complex transitions, encapsulating them helps organize animation logic separately, making it easier to tweak or reuse.

<br>

**7Ô∏è‚É£ When You Need to Apply Specific Modifiers to a View**
* If a view requires several specific modifiers (such as padding, background, or cornerRadius), encapsulating the view ensures that all the necessary modifiers are applied in a clean and reusable way.
